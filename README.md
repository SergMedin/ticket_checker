# ticket checker
## Description
I wrote this script for my friends who wanted to buy tickets for FIFA 2022. The script checks the ticket resale service, and if it finds tickets, reports them in telegram chat. The script actively uses proxies. In order not to be banned.

You could use this script to write such a script.

## How to use
1) set up credentials in secrets.py
2) run main.py

## Server
To work for a few days, I ran this script on my server in tmux.
